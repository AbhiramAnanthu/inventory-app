# **Inventory App**

## **Abstract**

This project is an **Inventory Management Application**, created as part of learning **Node.js** through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs). The app provides an interface to manage inventory items, including features such as adding, editing, deleting, and viewing inventory details.

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **EJS templating**, along with practical knowledge of handling database operations and creating dynamic web pages.

## **Features**
- **User-friendly Interface:** Manage inventory through simple and intuitive pages.
- **CRUD Operations:** Add, edit, view, and delete inventory items easily.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Use EJS templates to create dynamic and reusable HTML pages.
- **Database Integration:** Store and manage inventory data using **NeonDB**, a cloud-based PostgreSQL database.
- **Middleware:** Leverage Express.js middleware for routing, error handling, and data validation.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js:** Core JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for routing and middleware.
- **PostgreSQL (NeonDB):** Cloud-based database platform for reliable data management.

### **Frontend:**
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates):** For rendering dynamic views.

### **Tools & Deployment:**
- **NeonDB:** Scalable PostgreSQL database in the cloud.
